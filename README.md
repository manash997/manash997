## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Manash**, and I'm a machine learning engineer with a strong focus on **NLP** and **Text to Speech**. Currently, I'm actively working on TTS and NLP for Indian languages. I hold a masters degree in computer engineering and have a deep passion for machine learning.
Before my current role as an **ML Engineer at Paisabazaar**, I worked as a **Research Associate (NLP) at IIT BHU** under the **Bhashini Program**, an initiative of **MeitY, Government of India**.  

During this time, I:  
- Developed a **Python tool** for **Universal Semantic Representation (USR)** of Hindi sentences, integrating **POS tagging, Named Entity Recognition, and Dependency Parsing**.  
- Trained a **state-of-the-art Hindi POS tagger** using the **mT5-base model**.  
- Fine-tuned **mT5** for **predicting missing vibhaktis** and **detecting complex predicates** in Hindi sentences.  
- Designed a **sequence-to-sequence framework** using **mT5-large** to reconstruct Hindi sentences from their **linearized USR graph representations**.
